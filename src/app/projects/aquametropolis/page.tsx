          <h4>ChatGPT</h4>
          <p>
            Since ChatGPT is good at forming ideas and stories, I communicated
            with it to form the storyline below.
          </p>
          <blockquote className="quote">
            <p>
              The film unfolds amidst the neon-lit, bioluminescent coral reefs
              of AquaMetropolis, where humans build their undersea cities
              alongside marine creatures that curiously observe their efforts.
              Initially, scenes appear tranquil, highlighting the coexistence
              between humans and marine life. However, as the narrative deepens,
              viewers witness the fragility of this equilibrium. One of the most
              poignant moments in &quot;AquaMetropolis&quot; occurs during a
              powerful underwater eventâ€”an awe-inspiring storm or a captivating
              marine migration. This event serves as a stark reminder of
              humanity&apos;s vulnerability and powerlessness in the face of
              nature&apos;s unyielding forces. The film captures the shock and
              humility that humans experience when confronted by the
              overwhelming beauty and strength of the natural world, urging us
              to reevaluate our place within it. &quot;AquaMetropolis&quot; is a
              visually stunning and emotionally charged exploration of a future
              where harmony with nature is a fragile yet deeply meaningful
              journey, all set against the backdrop of a Cyberpunk-inspired
              undersea world.

          <h4>Midjourney</h4>
          <p>
            I used Midjourney for text-to-image generation because it is known
            for its well-trained aesthetics and various art styles.

          <h4>Pika Labs and Runway ML</h4>
          <p>
            I used Pika Labs and Runway ML for image-to-video generation, and
            eventually chose Pika Labs because it is free and stable.

          <h4>Photoshop Generative Fill</h4>
          <p>
            I used Photoshop together with Midjourney for image generation,
            fine-tuning, and image expansion.Photoshop Generative Fill function
            allows me to specify what to fill in a specific range in the image
            and comes in handy for expanding the original image. While
            Midjourney&apos;s image-expanding function is usually of fixed size,
            Photoshop Generative Fill allows image expansion to any dimension
            required.

          <h4>Audio & Video Editing</h4>
          <p>To generate narrated audio, I put the transcript into Elevenlabs, a text-to-speech AI tool. ElevenLabs provides many voices and allows voice customizations including Stability, Clarity+Similarity Enhancement, and Style Exaggeration. </p>
          <p>I used Stable Audio to generate the BGM and it worked better than my expectation. I used MyEdit for generating sound effects like the explosion sounds. </p>
          <p>For video editing, I tried Descript, Premiere Pro, and CapCut. I found CapCut most handy and efficient for my project.</p>
